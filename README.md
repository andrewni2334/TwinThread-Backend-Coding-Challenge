How to use TwinThreadChallenge.py:

*The code was written with Python 3 on the Pycharm CE IDE*

When you run the program, the output console should prompt the user to input an integer that corresponds to the action that the user would like to perform. By then, the JSON data should have already been imported from the link provided.  Each action is explained below:

1. Read JSON test assest data 
if the user would like to look at the data provided, option 1 allows the user to access the JSON data in a web browser
(this was just something i wanted to play around with when importing data)

2. Search of asset data by name, description, etc. 
if the user would like to locate a particular asset by providing either its name, description, or asset ID, option 2 can
execute this action.  The user must specify what attribute he or she is searching for and then type in the name of the particular attribute and the output console will return other aspects of the particular asset

3. List all assets that have a critical status 
this option allows the user to see all assets that have a crticial status and displays other attributes that those assets posess. 

4. Count unique class names 
This option will count up all of the assets in the assets list and provide the number at the end.  It will also give you the option to list out all of the class names if they are relevent. 

5. Build a visual hierarchy for a given asset id 
I did not have time to complete this challenge question
